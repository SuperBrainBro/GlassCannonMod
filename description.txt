Can you beat Terraria with double the damage, but a quarter of the health?

A small mod - Glass Cannon - rewards players for playing well while also punishing mistakes. Summary: +Damage -HP

Settings in config can tweak 'just' exactly how you want the difficulty to be affected, including if you even want a damage buff at all!
Stat Impact 1: +25% damage, -20% health. Stat Impact level 3 (Default): +200% damage, -60% health. Stat Impact level 5: +300% damage, -100% health.
